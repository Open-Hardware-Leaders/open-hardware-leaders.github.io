### **Week 5: Building your project**

_Testing and making experiments to validate core ideas is what you do  to make sure the requirements you are aiming for are the right requirements. This basically means making sure that you are **doing the right thing**. This section is** about doing things right**. Once you have scoped your project to decide how your next release will be, what features will have, what architecture, design and specifications based on your validations, the idea is that you commit to a set of features._

**Goal of the week**



*   Learn to prioritize and scope releases
*   Plan and start running a sprint based on your defined priorities

_Tip: Scope a sprint that you can run in 2-4 weeks_


**Assignments**

*   Define the scope statement for your participation in the program
*   Prioritize your work based on feasibility and relevance, using the github project board
*   Decompose your test cards in achievable activities in a timeline (or tasks)
*   Move these tasks into the sprint backlog planning.
*   If you have new hypothesis and ideas update your canvas. What would you do to validate these ideas, what experiments would you design?

_Tip: It is possible that two test cards require several steps that you might want to break down into separate issues and assign them to different people in your team._
