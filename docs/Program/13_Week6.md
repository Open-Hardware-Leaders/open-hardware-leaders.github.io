# Week 6: Building for open

_Your project grows when more and more diverse people jump in and contribute to it. This week you will go through a set of principles, values and concrete tools that will help you lower access barriers for your users and contributors, besides designing strategies for ensuring a welcoming space for everyone._

**Goal of the week:** Create entry points for contributors and users (Contributor User channels)/ Websites, issues, repositories, labels, code of conduct.

**Assignments:**

*   Create issues for contributors to jump into your project
*   Write your contribution guidelines
*   Who is participating and who is not in your project? Think of strategies for engaging and including wider audiences, and define your community guidelines (or code of conduct).
*   If you have new hypothesis and ideas update your canvas. What would you do to validate these ideas, what experiments would you design?
