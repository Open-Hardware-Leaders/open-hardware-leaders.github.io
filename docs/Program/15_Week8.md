# Week 8: Peer review

_Similar to week 4, it is time to share your progress with your fellow cohort mentees! We hope that we covered interesting and useful topics since the last peer review, so that when you revise your project, it will be easy to spot what can be improved and how these improvements will help you in the task to make your project as open and as sustainable as possible._

**Goal of the week:** Expose your work to fellow mentees and get useful feedback to continue working on your project.

**Assignment:**

*   Prepare a max 5â€™ pitch based on your revised canvas, get feedback on your new assumptions. Your pitch must include your new assumptions about engaging contributors, channels, CoC and community model.
