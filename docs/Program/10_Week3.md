# Week 3: Start testing and validating your ideas

_You now have a better understanding of your project’s value proposition and scope of your participation in this program. Taking into account the stage your project is in, you will formulate ideas and concrete tests that will help you make decisions for advancing your project._

_E.g. if your project has already considerable user validation, and has a prototype, you may want to focus your tests on documentation, raising funds or community building. Also, they might be interested in learning specific tools such as freeCAD, KiCAD, etc._

### Goal of the week:
- Learn to design and frame experiments to validate key hypothesis in your project

**Assignments:**

*   Extract 6 key hypothesis/assumptions that are related to your core value proposition
*   Design experiments (tasks) that tackle those specific hypotheses, goals, targets
*   Consider which resources do you need to achieve them. Which resources do you already have at hand? How can your mentor help you in getting those resources you need?
*   Open issues that describe the experiments you designed and use the project board in GitHub to reflect which actions you will take.
*   If you have new hypothesis and ideas update your canvas. What would you do to validate these ideas, what experiments would you design?

**_Hint: The first basic validation should be researching on how other people address the problems you are trying to tackle. We don’t want to reinvent the wheel!_**
