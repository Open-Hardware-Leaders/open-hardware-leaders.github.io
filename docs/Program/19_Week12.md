# **Week 12: Global sprint**

_Now it's the time to go crazy with your project. In the last weeks you worked a lot on defining your project and opening it up for possible contributors. During the global sprint you will attract contributors to your project from a diversity of open hardware communities to collaboratively work on open tasks. Use the momentum of the community to advance your project._

**Goal of the week:** Networking, spreading the word and empathizing with potential community members and peers.

**Goal as a contributor:** Try to find minimum contribution you can make to another mentee’s project based on your skills, or consider working on something new to learn new skills.

**Assignments:**



*   Be available for your contributors’ questions and interactions
*   Share your experience and progress in real time on chat and social media
*   Try to contribute in at least one issue of another project
