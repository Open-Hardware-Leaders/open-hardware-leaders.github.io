_Meet this week with your mentor! ☝ Check the video and review the value proposition you drafted. Start scoping your project goals, as well as your goals for this program. Your mentor should get a general idea about the status and stage of the project, if you have a prototype or a product, if the project has a user base, among other things. This week you will define more thourougly the assumptions and hypotheses underlying your project._


### **Goal of the week:** 
- Define your value proposition clearly and start identifying your core hypotheses and assumptions, and status regarding validations 

**Assignments**:



*   Fill in the canvas the best you can try to be specific and concrete
*   Identify which aspects (technical and non-technical) in your project need further development and which have been sufficiently validated
