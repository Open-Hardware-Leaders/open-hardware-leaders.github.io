# Week 10: Licensing and documentation

_You have been working hard on designing and building your open project, including how you want people to interact with it and build a community around it. Documentation is probably one of the most unattended and important aspects of this process, itâ€™s the cooking recipe that will let others replicate and tweak your ideas. Furthermore, choosing the appropriate open licenses will turn this interaction and the future perspectives into a smooth process or a nightmare, in terms of the hardware but also software and content you are producing._

**Goal of the week:** acquire best practices for hardware documentation and understand the different open licensing options available.

**Assignments:**

*   Check up on documentation
*   Choose a license for your project
*   If you have new hypothesis and ideas update your canvas. What would you do to validate these ideas, what experiments would you design?
