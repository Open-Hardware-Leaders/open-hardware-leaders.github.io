# **Week 2: Personas & pathways**

_One of the most important aspects in open source hardware projects is understanding who your contributors and users will be. Learn how to bring contributors onto your project by using tools called "personas" and "pathways." These tools will help you plan and test how you'll interact with new contributors, and imagine what is really involved for the contributor to succeed._

### Goal of the week:
- Profile and identify the kinds of people that will use and/or contribute in your project

**Assignments:**



*   Create a persona and pathway for your project, or more if necessary
*   Update your project repository with a good README file, example: [https://github.com/vektorious/light](https://github.com/vektorious/lightM)
*   If you have new hypothesis and ideas on user and contributor profiles update your canvas. What would you do to validate these ideas, what experiments would you design?
