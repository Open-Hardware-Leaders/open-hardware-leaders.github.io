# Week 9: Roadmapping

_In the previous week you made a review of your canvas and got feedback on new assumptions. Basically you had the opportunity to go through a small cycle of identifying a problem, making an assumption on how to solve it and finding ways to test it. By reviewing things you can make better decisions on whether to keep or ditch your proposed solution and refine your model._

_This week you are going to be working on creating a [roadmap](https://business-docs.co.uk/document-templates/roadmap-document-templates/what-is-a-project-roadmap/)**. **Basically, you will take time to think about the long term goals for the specific artifact you’re building but also for the project in general (one way to do that is using [theory of change](https://www.theoryofchange.org/what-is-theory-of-change/)), and break it down to turn it into actionable steps. These steps can be divided into short, mid and long term goals. In GitHub this can be translated into issues and goals in the Kanban board._

**Goal of the week:** Visualizing your project in short, mid long term management (Time management)

**Assignments:**



*   Create a [Kanban board in github](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-project-boards), make it visible for everyone and write down the ultimate goal for your project.
*   From there work backwards on what needs to happen so that goal is achieved. Once the steps are done, think about how to translate those steps into actionable issues. Don’t forget to create issues for all levels of contributors!
*   If you have new hypothesis and ideas update your canvas. What would you do to validate these ideas, what experiments would you design?
