# Selected Projects 
### First Open Hardware Leaders cohort 

## Open River Monitoring System: RiMo
Applicant: **Salman Faris**


A River Monitoring system to predict floodings in India, which can monitor parameters such as river water flow rate, river water level, rain gauge and additionally river water quality sensor.

## VASILAR (Automatized Version of Sucesive Ionic Layer Adsorption and Reaction)
Applicant: **Jesús Alba**


The project consists of manufacturing and automating a system to perform a semiconductor material growth technique, known as SILAR. The system would serve all investigators who study and manufacture their own research samples. It consists of a mechanical arm and a rotating disk that allows the sample to be introduced in the different solutions as many times as required, as well as varying other parameters such as immersion speed, drying time, etc.

## Solar Tracking System for Photovoltaic Modules Measurements
Applicant: **Rolando Cabrera**


Tracking system for measurement test of open-air photovoltaic modules. This project already has a python program on a Raspberry Pi that requires significant improvements. This program is capable of plotting an IV curve of a photovoltaic module, as well as measuring global solar radiation. It is necessary to integrate this program into tracking to achieve full system operation.

## PV Drone
Applicant: **Kevin Rivero**


PV Drone consists of the implementation of an unmanned aerial vehicle equipped with a calibrated thermographic camera, which is gyrostabilized and has a real-time video and photo transmission system for thermographic inspection of modules in photovoltaic parks. For PV Drone, the design and construction of a drone is necessary, as well as its coupling to a thermal imager, guaranteeing stability and safety during flight time.


## Imaging platform for disease diagnosis in Mexican rural areas
Applicant: **José Ocampo**


Low cost imaging platform, capable of performing bright-field and fluorescence microscopy, optimized for disease diagnosis (prevalent diseases in the region, e.g., dengue, tuberculosis, etc.). 

## LoRa Data Loggers for environmental quality
Applicant: **Alejo Bonifacio**

Usually recording environmental variables can be carried out by private data loggers. These devices, due to their high costs, or being of closed design, do not allow us to buy in quantity or build them. Our proposal consists in the design and development of open hardware data loggers with LoRaWan technology for communication with devices for downloading data. The data loggers will be of two types: aquatic and terrestrial. Aquatics will measure relevant data for the determination of water quality such as turbidity, dissolved oxygen, conductivity and pH. The terrestrial, will measure bee activity variables in hive, biological indicators of environmental quality.


## Nibbla
Applicant: **Daniel Beiter**

Versatile "self-aware" data logger for monitoring environmental data based on the Teensy development board. Designed for very low power consumption (battery only / battery + solar), remote communication (LoRa/LTE) and multiple interfaces (RS485/SDI12/...) to work with many (non-)comercial sensors. Self-aware means, the system monitors itself: changes in power consumption, changes in sensor IDs or any system setup. Also, automated logging when someone works on the system. Very important for meta data and potential data publication.

## Otto DIY
Applicant: **Camilo Parra**

An interactive robot that anyone can make: ottodiy.com .

## Corchea
Applicant: **Gonzalo Vidal Pena**

Constant flow paper-based microfluidics, using negative pressure.

## Alquimétricos, ecotechnological toys
Applicant: **Fernando Daguanno**

An open source,  DIY, collaborative initiative for design, production, and sharing of  OER STEAM educational toys. Kind of a poor’s man Lego brick based upon geodesic and tensegrity structures building systems.


## UC2
Applicant: **Barbora Maršíková**

Modular, cost-effective, complexity-reduced, yet high-resolution microscopy system. Its low price and high availability makes it suitable for using it in field research, educational environments or development countries to help understanding the principle of optics or detect e.g. waterborne-parasites in the field.
